        <p>
        I aim to build technology that solves real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
        My journey involves exploring Al, cloud systems, and data analytics where I thrive on transforming ideas into meaningful solutions. Building novel applications excites me, especially when it involves exploring machine learning and deep learning. Iâ€™ve been focused on developing software applications and computer vision solutions, leveraging technologies like PyTorch, NumPy, Node.js, React, and SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
        Outside of code, I love diving into hackathons, staying curious about emerging tools, and collaborating with others who share a vision for innovation.
